# Terrace_field

A simple script that I wrote while working at OBI - a home improvement store

As an input, it takes a few parameters:
  - product ID that was chosen by client
  - measurements (in several variants) of a terrace that client want to renovate

And it returns how many e.g. planks or paver blocks client has to buy, and costs of mentioned materials

I was running it on my Raspberry Pi through SSH on my phone
